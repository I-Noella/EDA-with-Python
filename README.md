# Projects
Hi, welcome to my first Repository here. This is a repository containing some Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python completed by me for self learning.They are presented in form of Jupyter notebooks
## Contents
1. **[EDA Project1](https://github.com/I-Noella/My-First-EDA-with-Python/blob/main/EDA%20project1.ipynb)**

This is my first ever exploratory data analysis and visualization using Python programming Language. The dataset is about coffee sales in walmart stores and how the variables such as price, rating ang weight relates with one other. Enjoy!

2. **[Chocolate bars project](https://github.com/I-Noella/EDA-with-Python/blob/main/EDA%20projects/chocolate%20bars%20project.ipynb)**
 
In this project, I attempted to analyse some chocolate bars data from Datacamp to determine whether some fields of the data can be used independently to obtain insights about the entire dataset as touching quality of the chocolate bars.
